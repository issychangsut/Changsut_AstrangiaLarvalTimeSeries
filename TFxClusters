# Step 1: Merge FIMO and cluster data from the DTW analysis (making sure that both will merge/match using the Gene column)
# Step 2: Summarize motif enrichment for each cluster 
# Step 3: Find any driving motifs from each cluster
# Step 4: Map the motifs to link each one to the best-matching transcription factor 
# Step 5: ID the top transcription factors per cluster
