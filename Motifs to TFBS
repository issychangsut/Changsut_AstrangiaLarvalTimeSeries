## Identifying protein motifs and transcription factor binding sites 
## this is based off phil cleves scripts from https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2015737117

# The pipeline for this analysis uses Python, Bash, and R and requires:
  # your featureCounts output from the readme (list of genes of interest)
  # FASTA genome file
  # GFF3 file 
This file describes how to do this via:
# Step 1: Identify which genes are repeated, or which genes you are interested in from a table (e.g., featureCounts output, GO annotations, or exon mappings)
# Step 2: Slice promoter regions from the genome using the GFF3 file; output: fasta file with promoter sequences for genes of interest
# Step 3: Extract sequences from a FASTA file (e.g., the promoters you sliced in step 2) based on a list of IDs; output: FASTA w only the relevant sequences
# Step 4: Create a randomized control for the motif/binding site analysis but keep the sequence lengths and identifiers (last bc you can't randomize until you know your sequences of interest
# Step 5: Motif discovery -- run MEME to discover motifs (identify statistically enriched motifs in the promoter sequences
# Step 6: Compare the discovered motifs to database of motifs (JASPAR) using TOMTOM to find which transcription factorsa likely belong to; output: best mathcing motif in JASPAR, similarity score and alignment 
# Step 7: Use FIMO to scan the sequences and count the occurence of each binding site hit
